# The new 100fm digital

I really like the digital channels of 100fm - [https://digital.100fm.co.il](https://digital.100fm.co.il)/.
As part of self-learning of frontend I decided to build a "clone" of the site on my additional features. The database connects to the 100fm API from the link https://d203uamca1bsc4.cloudfront.net/app/
Many thanks to 100fm for the inspiration for my project.
